# React + Vite

WTWR (What to wear) is an app that helps the user decide what they should wear based on the weather.

The header displays the user's current city and the date, a button to add more clothing options to the list and the user's name and choosen avatar. It also has a "weather card" that displays the temperature of the user's city and it's degrees in Fahrenheit. There is also a toggle switch that changes the temperature displays from Fahrenheit to Celsius when it is clicked on.
